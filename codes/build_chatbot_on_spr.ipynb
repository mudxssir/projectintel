This allows the model to better understand the nuances of each language while still benefiting from the broader understanding gained during pre-training.\n",

      "3. Cross-lingual representation learning: Develop shared representations for words or phrases across languages, enabling the model to recognize similarities between related terms in different languages. This can lead to improved performance when dealing with diverse linguistic expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Contextualized word embeddings: Use contextualized word embeddings, such as BERT, GPT-2, or XLNet, which consider the surrounding text when generating word representations. These models capture the meaning of words based on their usage within specific contexts, leading to more accurate sentiment analysis.\n"
